            As a Ukrainian, I started this interactive art project after the
            full-scale russian invasion of Ukraine. Initially, I had considered
            several different concepts. Wheat sprouts growing from blood, or
            maybe dried blood that would have been replaced by green grass.

            <br /><br />
            After the recent news from <b>Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin</b>, there
            will be no more grass. <b>Only blood and pain.</b> They will never
            dry out, never disappear. <br /><br />
            There are mutilated corpses of civilians on the streets and in mass
            graves. Thousands of Ukrainian citizens were tortured and killed by
            the russian army. The russians have hastily burned the bodies of
            raped children and women. Not sure if they were trying to cover up
            their war crimes, or if it was just done for "entertainment". They
            killed everyone, even pets, for no reason. This is not a war.
            <b>This is a genocide.</b> <br /><br />
            And we continue to receive horrifying messages from
            <b>Mariupol</b> and other cities.
            <b>The situation is even worse there.</b> <br /><br />

          <p class="section-paragraph">
            Put pressure on authorities to
            <b>immediately impose ALL sanction packages on russia!</b> There is
            no excuse for sponsoring crimes against humanity. No thermometer
            notch, no length of conveyor belt should cost the lives of innocent
            people. <br /><br />
            <b>Send offensive weapons to Ukraine</b>. Do not hide under the
            guise of pacifism while our army finds parts from "peaceful"
            countries in russian military vehicles. Hypocrisy is disgusting.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Stop supporting dishonored politicians</b> who justify
            "friendship" with russian federation to pursue the interests of
            their own country. They are not even the Chamberlains of our times.
            They are modern Quislings. Voting for pathetic nazi collaborators is
            kin to participation in their crimes. <br /><br />
            <b>Forget about dialogue with russia</b>. Totalitarian autocracies
            do not follow the rational logic of a democratic world. We must not
            encourage terrorists. <b>The russian reich must be destroyed</b>,
            and the peoples of russian federation must be given the right to
            self-determination. <br /><br />

            And remember,
