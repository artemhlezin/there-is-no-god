There is no God in 2022, except for the Armed Forces of Ukraine


As a Ukrainian, I started this interactive art project after the full-scale russian invasion of Ukraine. Initially, I had considered several different concepts. Wheat sprouts growing from blood, or maybe dried blood that would have been replaced by green grass.

After the recent news from Bucha, Hostomel, and Irpin, there will be no more grass. Only blood and pain. They will never dry out, never disappear.
